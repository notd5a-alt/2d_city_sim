# A simple 2d city building sim
> For now this project is really basic, i have been working on it to serve as the backend for a future game i am planning to make

It's simply a 2d tile based, dynamically generated world of size x, y.

There can be multple people in the world and multiple buildings.

Right now there isnt much to do, in future though it will be playable
